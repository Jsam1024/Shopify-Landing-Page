            <button class="accordion">What is Shopify and how does it work?</button>
            <p class="text">Shopify is a complete commerce platform that lets you start, grow, and manage a business.

                With Shopify, you can:
                
                Create and customize an online store
                Sell in multiple places, including web, mobile, social media, online marketplaces, brick-and-mortar locations, and pop-up shops
                Manage products, inventory, payments, and shipping
                
                Shopify is completely cloud-based and hosted, which means you don't have to 
                worry about upgrading or maintaining software or web servers. This gives you 
                the flexibility to access and run your business from almost anywhere, 
                including your mobile device.</p>
            <hr>
            <button class="accordion">How much does Shopify cost?</button>
            <p class="text">Try Shopify free for 3 days, no credit card required.

                After your trial expires, choose a pricing plan that suits the size and 
                stage of your business.</p>
            <hr>
            <button class="accordion">Can I use my own domain name with Shopify?</button>
            <p class="text">Yes, you can use your own domain name with Shopify.

                If you have an existing domain name, you can connect it to Shopify from your store's admin.
                
                If you don't have a domain name yet, you can either buy one 
                through Shopify or a third-party provider.</p>
            <button class="accordion">Do I need to be a designer or developer to use Shopify?</button>
            <p class="text">No, you don't need to be a designer or developer to use Shopify.

                Signing up for Shopify allows you to:
                
                Customize the look and feel of your store with the online store builder and themes.
                Add features and functionality to your store with apps.
                
                If you need extra help, you can contact our support team, or visit the Shopify 
                Expert Marketplace to search for and hire a certified Shopify expert.</p>
