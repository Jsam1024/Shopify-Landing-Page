            <p class="text">Shopify is a complete commerce platform that lets you start, grow, and manage a business.<br><br>With Shopify, 
                you can:<br>
                 &#8226; Create and customize an online store <br>
                &#8226; Sell in multiple places, including web, mobile, social media, online marketplaces, brick-and-mortar locations, and pop-up shops <br>
                &#8226; Manage products, inventory, payments, and shipping <br> <br>
                
                Shopify is completely cloud-based and hosted, which means you don't have to 
                worry about upgrading or maintaining software or web servers. This gives you 
                the flexibility to access and run your business from almost anywhere, 
                including your mobile device.</p>

                through Shopify or a third-party provider.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Do I need to be a designer or developer to use Shopify?</button>
            <p class="text">No, you don't need to be a designer or developer to use Shopify. <br><br>
